<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Dialysis Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial dialysis device market is primarily categorized into two types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves the use of a machine to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood outside the body, typically performed in clinics or at home. In contrast, peritoneal dialysis utilizes the lining of the abdomen, or peritoneum, to filter blood, relying on a fluid exchange process. Both modalities offer vital treatment options for patients with kidney failure, addressing diverse patient needs and lifestyles.</p></p>
