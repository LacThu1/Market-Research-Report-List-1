<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optics Testing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Mode</li><li>Mutimode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optics testing device market is primarily divided into two types: single mode and multimode. Single mode fibers have a small core diameter, allowing only one light mode to propagate, which is ideal for long-distance communication due to lower attenuation. Conversely, multimode fibers have a larger core, enabling multiple light modes, making them suitable for shorter distances within buildings or campuses. Testing devices are essential for ensuring optimal performance and reliability in both fiber types, addressing distinct application needs.</p></p>
