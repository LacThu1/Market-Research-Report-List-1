<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radar Level Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Radar Level Gauge</li><li>Guided Wave Radar Level Gauge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radar level gauge market consists of two primary types: non-contact radar level gauges and guided wave radar level gauges. Non-contact radar level gauges utilize microwave radar signals to measure the distance to the surface of a fluid without physical contact, making them ideal for challenging environments. Guided wave radar level gauges, on the other hand, employ a probe to transmit radar waves along a guided path, providing precise measurements even in complex conditions, such as high pressure or temperature applications. Both types enhance process efficiency and safety.</p></p>
