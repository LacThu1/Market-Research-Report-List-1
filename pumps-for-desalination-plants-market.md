<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Desalination Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In desalination plants, pumps are crucial for transporting seawater and brine efficiently. Centrifugal pumps, utilizing rotational energy, are commonly employed for their high flow rates and energy efficiency, making them ideal for large-scale operations. Positive displacement pumps, on the other hand, move fluids by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it through the discharge, providing consistent flow and high pressure, essential for reverse osmosis processes. Both types cater to specific operational needs in the desalination market, enhancing overall efficacy.</p></p>
