<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric Butterfly Valves</li><li>Doubly-eccentric Butterfly Valves</li><li>Triply-eccentric Butterfly Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial butterfly valves market encompasses three main types: concentric, doubly-eccentric, and triply-eccentric valves. Concentric butterfly valves feature a disc centered on the valve shaft, suitable for lower-pressure applications. Doubly-eccentric valves have an off-center disc design that reduces wear and allows for higher efficiency and pressure handling. Triply-eccentric valves introduce an additional offset, ensuring a tighter seal and minimizing wear, making them ideal for high-pressure and high-temperature applications in demanding environments. Each type serves specific industrial needs based on performance criteria.</p></p>
